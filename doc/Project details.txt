? A short description of the project: 

Our system is called JavaWookies Time Tracking System. This is simply a Login/Logout system that allows 2 types of user to login. You can incorporate image of your company logo on our system design. In this system, it will gives an error message if the user enters incorrect password. The users are classified as Employee and Admin, both can sign in to their specific accounts and see its corresponding details. The system records the time of a specific user who  login/logout based on the system timer. The user Employee has the ability to check its login/logout details on that day. While The user Admin has the ability to add, delete and edit information of new and old employees. Also Admin can generate reports if wanted to see who are the employees logged in on that specified date. Our system for now stores password on a manual basis. Meaning, user Employee can't reset it, only the Admin can change it manually to the Employee's specific account details.
