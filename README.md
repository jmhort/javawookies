• A short description of the project: 

Our system is called JavaWookies Time Tracking System. This is simply a 
Login/Logout system that allows 2 types of user to login. You can 
incorporate image of your company logo on our system design. In this 
system, it will gives an error message if the user enters incorrect 
password. The users are classified as Employee and Admin, both can sign 
in to their specific accounts and see its corresponding details. The 
system records the time of a specific user who  login/logout based on 
the system timer. The user Employee has the ability to check its 
login/logout details on that day. While The user Admin has the ability 
to add, delete and edit information of new and old employees. Also 
Admin can generate reports if wanted to see who are the employees 
logged in on that specified date. Our system for now stores password on 
a manual basis. Meaning, user Employee can't reset it, only the Admin 
can change it manually to the Employee's specific account details.
